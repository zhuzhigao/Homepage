					Welcome to Zhigao's family home page!
				</p>
				<p>
					We are the small family with three members: the father, the mother and the cutest son int he world. This site records some of the important moments of the family - something we'd like to share and would expect you to enjoy. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Hope from these site, you can get to know us, and feel our life. We're normal, just like millions of Chinease families, yet we are also unique, as the only Zhigao's family in the world.
				</p>
				<p>
					PS. This site achieved two of Zhigao's objectives of year 2015: 1) create a family site; 2) practice one technology learned this year - guess what technology it is:-).
